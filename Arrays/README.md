# Arrays – DSA Practice

This folder contains array-based Data Structures and Algorithms problems solved in Python as part of my DSA preparation using Striver’s DSA Sheet.

The problems are divided into **Easy** and **Medium** levels to reflect a gradual increase in difficulty and logical complexity.

### Concepts Covered
- Array traversal and manipulation
- Finding maximum and minimum elements
- Prefix sum techniques
- Two pointer basics
- Kadane’s Algorithm
- Optimized problem-solving approaches

The focus of these solutions is on writing clean, readable, and optimized code suitable for campus placement interviews.
