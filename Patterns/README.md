# Pattern Printing – DSA Fundamentals

This folder contains pattern printing problems solved using Python.  
These problems focus on building a strong foundation in **loops, nested loops, and logical thinking**, which are essential for learning Data Structures and Algorithms.

Pattern problems are useful for understanding how iterations work and how to control rows, columns, and conditions effectively.

### Concepts Covered
- Nested loops
- Row and column control
- Star (`*`) patterns
- Number patterns (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Pyramid, triangle, square, and inverted patterns
- Logical observation and implementation

These problems help improve problem-solving confidence and are especially useful for beginners before moving to advanced DSA topics.
