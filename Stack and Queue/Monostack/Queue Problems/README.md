# 📚 Monotonic Stack Problems (Completed)

This repository contains my solutions to **important Monotonic Stack problems**, implemented with a clear focus on **intuition, efficiency, and interview readiness**.

All problems are solved using **optimal stack-based approaches** with proper handling of edge cases and time/space complexity.

---

## ✅ Problems Covered

The following problems have been completed and implemented:

1. **Next Greater Element**
2. **Next Greater Element II**
3. **Next Smaller Element**
4. **Number of Next Greater Elements to the Right**
5. **Trapping Rainwater**
6. **Sum of Subarray Minimums**
7. **Asteroid Collision**
8. **Sum of Subarray Ranges**
9. **Remove K Digits**
10. **Largest Rectangle in a Histogram**
11. **Maximal Rectangle (Binary Matrix)**

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Used

- Monotonic Increasing Stack
- Monotonic Decreasing Stack
- Nearest Greater / Smaller Elements
- Stack-based range calculation
- Histogram-based area computation
- Prefix height technique (for matrix problems)

---

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

All solutions are optimized:

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` or `O(rows × cols)` where applicable  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for stack and auxiliary arrays

Each element is pushed and popped from the stack **at most once**.

## 🎯 Why This Set is Important

These problems:
- Form the **foundation of Monotonic Stack**
- Frequently appear in **coding interviews**
- Are reusable patterns for many advanced problems

Completing this set means strong command over:
- Stack-based thinking
- Range expansion problems
- Histogram and matrix transformations

---

## 🚀 Notes

- All solutions are written in a **beginner-friendly style**
- Emphasis is on **logic clarity**, not just passing test cases
- Suitable for **revision before interviews**
