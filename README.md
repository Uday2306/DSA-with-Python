# DSA-with-Python
This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice solutions in Python, based on Striver’s DSA Sheet.

The goal of this repository is to strengthen problem-solving skills for campus placements and technical interviews.

Topics covered include Arrays, Strings, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Hashing, Stack, Queue, and Binary Search.

Solutions are written with clean logic and readability in mind.
