# 🧠 Two Pointers & Sliding Window – DSA Practice

This repository contains my solved **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems focused on the **Two Pointers** and **Sliding Window** techniques.

The aim of this repository is to:
- Build strong problem-solving fundamentals
- Understand common DSA patterns
- Write clean, optimal, and readable code
- Prepare for coding interviews and competitive programming

---

## 📌 Techniques Covered

### 🔹 Two Pointers
The Two Pointers technique uses two indices to traverse data structures efficiently, often reducing time complexity from O(n²) to O(n).

**Common use cases:**
- Working with sorted arrays
- Subsequence problems
- Pair sum problems
- String matching
- Shrinking or expanding ranges

**Examples solved:**
- Valid Palindrome  
- Container With Most Water  
- Minimum Window Subsequence  
- Remove Duplicates  
- Subsequence Checking

### 🔹 Sliding Window
Sliding Window is used for problems involving **continuous subarrays or substrings**.  
A window is maintained using two pointers (`left` and `right`) that expands and shrinks dynamically.

**Common use cases:**
- Subarray / substring problems
- Minimum or maximum window problems
- Frequency-based problems
- Optimization problems

**Examples solved:**
- Minimum Window Substring  
- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters  
- Longest Repeating Character Replacement  
- Count Subarrays with Given Conditions
